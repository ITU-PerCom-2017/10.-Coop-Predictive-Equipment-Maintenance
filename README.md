will be the backend - The RPI will function as an accesspoint, which takes care of all the incomming data comming from the LoPy's, which works as recievers for the Estimote beacons. 

The Rpi will be running several java programs

## JAVA
* Java class for handling incomming data
* Algorithm for calculating paths of custormers

## LoPy - Pycon
Recievers for Estimote beacons. The LoPy will only take care of measuring RSSI, ID, and timecode on each regisetered Estimote beacon. these dates will be passed on from the recievers (LoPy) to the backend placed on the Access point(RPI)

## Estimote beacons
